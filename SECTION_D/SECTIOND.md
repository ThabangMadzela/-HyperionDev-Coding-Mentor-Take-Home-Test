# HyperionDev Coding Mentor Assessment
## SECTION D

### Option 1: Student Progress Intervention Plan
    To get the 5 lagging students back on track and ensure 
    that the 10 at-risk students do not fall behind while also 
    ensuring that the 5 ahead students are not negatively impacted, 
    I would follow the following intervention plan:

    1. Schedule individual meetings with each of the 5 lagging 
    students to understand their reasons for being behind and help 
    them develop a plan to catch up with the rest of the class.

    2. For the 10 at-risk students, I would schedule group meetings to 
    discuss their progress and help them identify any obstacles that may 
    be preventing them from completing tasks on time. I would work with 
    them to develop a plan to ensure they complete their tasks on time.

    3. For the 5 students ahead of expected progress, I would provide them 
    with additional challenging tasks to keep them engaged and motivated. 
    I would also encourage them to help their classmates who are falling 
    behind.

    4. Additionally, I would monitor the progress of all students 
    regularly and 
    adjust my intervention plan as needed.

### Option 2: Java Support Task

    To help the student who is having trouble 
    with Task 6 and the JOptionPane.ShowDialog() method, 
    I would follow the following process:

    1. I would ask the student to share their screen so 
    that I can see the code they have written.

    2. Review the code and look for any syntax errors or 
    logical mistakes that may be causing the issue.

    3. Explain to the student how the JOptionPane.ShowDialog() 
    method works and what it does. I would also highlight any 
    common mistakes that students make when using this method.

    4. Work with the student to identify any errors in 
    their code and help them fix it.

    5. Once the issue is resolved, I would ask the 
    student to explain the solution back to me to 
    ensure they have understood it correctly.
